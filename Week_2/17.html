        The Taj Mahal is an Islamic ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna in the Indian
        city of Agra. It was commissioned in 1631 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (1628-1658) to house the tomb of his
        favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a
        17-hectare complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three
        sides by a crenellated wall.
